## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google**:

- What the state of a component or a container is
- The lifecycle of a component
- How to modify a state and execute code in the right order
- What a controlled component is
- How to use Forms in React
- How to reuse smaller components, keep them pure, and lift its state to principal containers
- The use of a React Hook and how to create one
- How to test State changes with Enzyme
